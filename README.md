# Music Disk DJ

---
This mod allows you to seamlessly search music from YouTube and Soundcloud within the game and provides the functionality to replace vanilla music discs with your favorite songs. Also share your playlists with other players via books (beta 0.8.0, YT only for now). The mod is designed to be fully client-side.

## Download
